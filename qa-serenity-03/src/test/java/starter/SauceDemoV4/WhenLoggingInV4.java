    As a test class,
    it should only do that: test.
    it shouldnÂ´t extend from UIInteractions / PageObject
    since its propose is completely different
    (Single Responsibility Principle)

    That's why we use separated classes
    such as LoginActions ( interacting with the user data )
    and InventoryPage ( interacting with the page / web element )

        additional info:
        Also as a good practice, we should structure the project
        creating packages separating:
        - pages / actions / actor / test cases

          (Which elements are going to be just Pages
          and which ones just Actions.
          We don't have a page with actions,
          they're separated.)
